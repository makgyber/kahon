This is a wireless bluetooth, one-handed keyboard inspired by the Frogpad.
It is a minimal build, no diodes, and uses a nice!nano compatible controller. It is also not hot-swappable, but MX-profile or v1 choc-profile switches are supported. The firmware included is custom based on ZMK.

## Requirements

- 1pc nice!nano, or compatible board
- 20 switches (MX or choc v1)
- reset button
- 3.7v lithium battery
- power switch (optional)
- J1 socket (optional)

## Layout

I started with the Frogpad layout, but decided to completely change the first alpha-keys layer to match my typing style and workflow. Over the course of a weekend I redesigned the layout, moving letters around when it felt uncomfortable as I was using Monkeytype to test the layout.

## Case

I still haven't learned 3D modelling to print my own cases, but this is something I would like to start doing soon.
